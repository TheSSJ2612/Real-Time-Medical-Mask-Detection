# Real-Time-Medical-Mask-Detection

Face mask detection had seen a major progress in the fields of Computer vision and Image processing and since the rise of covid-19 pandemic this is today’s necessity. Many face detection models have been created using several different algorithms and classifiers. We are training our covid-19 mask detector using deep learning, Tensorflow, Keras and opencv. This model has the potential to be used for safety purposes. We aim to use a pre-trained model on which deep learning and computer vision pipelines have been used and implemented. Dataset used in this model has been made manually by collecting from several different resources and applying the technique of data augmentation on it so that a large dataset can be easily created. After the model is trained we’ll proceed further to test our model on static images and real time webcam. So basically this project has been divided into two parts, in the training part mask detection model will be trained using the dataset provided. and in the application part we will load our trained model to perform mask detection. We fine tuned our MobileNetV2 architecture on the dataset and obtained accuracy of about 92%, this architecture is extremely organized and can be applied on embedded devices (ex. NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry pi). We will be compiling our model using Adam Optimizer and we will use Binary Cross Entropy as a loss function. The output images are preprocessed for removing unwanted errors and will make a rectangle box around the mask or the face. The dataset provided in this model can be used by other researchers for further advanced models such as those of face recognition, facial landmarks and facial part detection process which will be our future research area.
